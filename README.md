Neural Networks for Regression and Classification
Developed Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to solve regression and classification problems using Python.
Regression: Predicted house prices using the California Housing dataset, including hyperparameter optimization with GridSearchCV.
Classification: Identified individuals based on facial images from the LFW People dataset. Compared the performance of ANNs and linear SVMs.
Technologies: Python, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib.
