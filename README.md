K-Means:

Clustering and Data Classification:

Manual implementation of K-Means for cluster analysis and optimization of the number of clusters using the silhouette coefficient.
Applied SVM with hyperparameter optimization via GridSearchCV on the Iris dataset, achieving up to 95% accuracy.
Compared clustering algorithms (DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixture, Spectral Clustering) on datasets with varying distributions.
Technologies: Python, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas; evaluation with silhouette metrics and accuracy.
